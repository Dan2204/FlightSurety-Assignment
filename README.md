Flight Surety Dapp set up instructions.<br/>

<br/>

The boilerplate code provided proved too painfull to get working. After sepending days trying everything 
and anything to get it functioning, I gave up and opted to upgrade the solidity code to version 8, and
start from scratch with the dapp. I was able to use snippets from the dapp boilerplate code, i.e. contract.js
and the server.js starting code. Everything else was built from scratch using next.js.

On reflection, the idea in my head was far bigger when put into practice. The code is fully functional but 
due to time restraints, I didn't spend much time on style and responsivness... Definately an app for desktop monitors!
